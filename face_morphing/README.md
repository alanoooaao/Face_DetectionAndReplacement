# Image Warpping and Face Morphing

Usage
-----
The package focuses on face morphing techniques. A morph is a simultaneous warp of the image shape and a cross-dissolve of the image 
colors. In the package, I implemented two basic morphing approaches, one is Triangulation morphing, the other is Thin Plate Spline (TPS).

Package Clarification
---------------------
Two main codes, 'tps_main.m' and 'Tria_main.m', using two morphing algorithms respectfully. The 'avi.m' is used to generated a video to show 
the morphing process.

Results
-------
You are supposed to see a video that represents face morphing process, starts from one face image to another face. Or you can try different 
objects for more interesting images.
