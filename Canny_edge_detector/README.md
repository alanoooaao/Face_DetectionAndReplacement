Usage
-----
The goal of this package is to compute the Canny Edges for any RGB images. Edge can be a good feauture of object detection in the computer vision realm.
Add the package to your catkin workspace. The main code for execution is 'cannyEdge.m', inputting any RGB image file and the return 
is a canny edge detection image. You can also run 'TestScript_P1.m' for code testing.


Package Clarification
---------------------
All source code store in the src file, 'edgeEval' folder stores ground truth edge detector codes, you can also take a look at 'reference' 
for more algorithm details.

Results
-------
Please feel free to take a look at results with both ground truth and edge detected images.
