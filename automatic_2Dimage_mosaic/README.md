# Automatic 2D Image Mosaic
This package focuses on the image feature detection, feature matching and image mosaic techniques. The goal is to create an image mosaic or stitching, which is a collection of small images which are aligned properly to create one larger image.        

The main algorithm follows the below two papers:         
[1) Multi-image Matching using Multi-scale image patches; ](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=1467310)      
[2) Shape Matching and Object Recognition Using Shape Contexts.](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.441.6897&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

Usage
-----
The package focuses on image feature detection, construction, matching and image mosaic techniques. Finally, the package can generate 
an panorama automatically which is a collection of small images which are aligned properly.


Package Clarification
---------------------
Add the package to your catkin workspace, execute 'mosaic_main.m'. Also you can select your own source images to generate a panorama.
